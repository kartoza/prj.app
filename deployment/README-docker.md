# Deploying with docker

**Note:** This documentation is intentionally generic so that it can
be copy-pasted between projects - do not put project specific details here.

This document explains how to do various sysadmin related tasks when your
site has been deployed under docker. These deployment modes are supported:

* **production**: no debug etc is enabled, has its own discrete database. Configure
  your production environment in core.settings.prod_docker - this
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is used when running in production mode.
* **staging**: Configure your staging environment in core.settings.staging_docker -
  this DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is used when running in production mode.

# Build your docker images and run them

## Production

You can simply run the provided script and it will build and deploy the docker
images for you in **production mode**.

```
cd deployment
make deploy
sudo chmod -R a+rwX static
```

Now point your browser at the ip of the web container on port 8080 or to the
host port mapping as defined in the docker-compose.yml file.


To make a superuser account do:

```
make shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
exit
```

## Staging

The procedure is exactly the same as production, but you should preceed 
each command with 'staging' e.g. ``make staging-deploy``.

**Note:** VERY IMPORTANT - for staging deployment you should use a **separate
git checkout**  from the production checkout as the code from the git checkout
is shared into the source tree.

## Using make

The following key make commands are provided for production:

* **build** - build production containers
* **run** - builds then runs db and uwsgi services
* **collectstatic** - collect static in production instance
* **migrate** - run django migrations in production instance

Additional make commands are provided in the Makefile - please see there
for details.

#### Arbitrary commands

Running arbitrary management commands is easy 


## Setup nginx reverse proxy

You should create a new nginx virtual host - please see
``*-nginx.conf`` in the deployment directory for examples. There is
one provided for production and one for staging.

Simply add the example file (renaming them as needed) to your 
``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`` directory and then modify the contents to 
match your local filesystem paths. Then use

```
sudo nginx -t
```

To verify that your configuration is correct and then reload / restart nginx
e.g.

```
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```


### Managing containers

Please refer to the general docker-compose documentation
for further notes on how to manage the infrastructure using docker-compose.

# Configuration options

You can configure the base port used and various other options like the
image organisation namespace and postgis user/pass by editing the ``docker-compose*.yml``
files.
