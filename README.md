## Quick Installation Guide

For deployment we use [docker](http://docker.com) so you need to have docker 
running on the host. Projecta is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

```
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/projecta.git
cd projecta/deployment
cp btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE btsync-db.env
cp btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE btsync-media.env
make build
make run
make migrate
make collectstatic
```

If you need backups, put btsync keys in these files. If you don't need backups, 
you can let the default content.

**intercom.io**

If you wish to make use of [intercom.io](https://www.intercom.io), include a
`private.py` file in `core.settings` with your `INTERCOM_APP_ID` as a string.
The necessary code snippet is already included in `project_base.html`.

**google authentication**

In social auth to use the google authentication you need to go to:

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials

Create and oath2 credential with these options:

Authorized redirect URIs

http://changelog.qgis.org<your domain>/en/complete/google-oauth2/

Use the projecta admin panel to set up the google account with your id and
secret

**github authentication**

Create a developer key here:

https://github.com/settings/applications/new

Set the callback and site homepage url to the top of your site e.g.

http://localhost:61202

At http://localhost:61202/en/site-admin/socialaccount/socialapp/add/

Set the key and secret from the github key page.

**Backups**

If you wish to sync backups, you need to establish a read / write btsync 
key on your production server and run one or more btsync clients 
with a read only key.

```
cd deployment
cp btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE btsync-media.env
cp btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE btsync-db.env
```

Now edit the ``btsync-media.env`` and ``btsync-db.env`` files, including 
relevant SECRET and DEVICE settings.
