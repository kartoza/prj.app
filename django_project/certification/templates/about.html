            The certification platform in Projecta is designed to provide an easy path for
            projects to be able to issue certification certificates. The system allows
            a project to approve one or more certification providers. These
            providers can then set up training centers and course conveners.
            Course conveners prepare a course and then attendees are assigned
            to that course. Once the course is completed, certificates get
            issued by the course convener in digital form. There is the
            opportunity to charge a fee for each certificate issued. This
            mechanism can be used to support the parent project.

            The following diagram provides a generalised overview of the
            certification process from the point of view of a certifying organisation.

            You may be wondering about our approach to certification. We looked
            at a number of approaches where we could provide a more rigorous
            and systematic way of certifying software users. These approaches can
            be split in two general approaches:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Computer based testing: Favoured by industry, in this approach the project owner
                would create a large pool of questions and then provide a test
                environment where a random subset of questions are allocated to
                the person being tested and they would carry out an online
                examination. There are a few issues with this approach including
                the need for a way to verify that the correct user actually
                undertook the exam and not a proxy, the need for a large amount
                of project input to create and maintain the test questions, and the
                general trend for examinees to go online and share the questions
                the were asked for future examinees. There is also the issue that
                sometimes complex (especially graphical) software is hard to
                examine in an environment where text based answers are expected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Portfolio based testing: Favoured by academia, this approach
                requires attendees to submit mini-projects or other projects
                such as maps and reports to demonstrate their competency. This
                has a downside that each evaluation is very personal and subjective.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Neither of these systems is really suitable for our needs so we have
            opted for a third choice: In this approach we create a "web of
            trust". In this approach we trust the organisations that provide
            training to properly issue certificates for their course attendees.
            We spend our time verifying the certifying organisation and then
            trust them to 'do the right thing' after that.

            Setting up the certification programme for your project starts with the
            creation of one or more certification managers in your project. Certification
            managers are moderators for the certification programme in your project.
            Only a project administrator can update the list of certification
            managers. The project owner and certification managers can then
            manage which users can approve and manage the list of certifying
            organisations. Whenever a new certifying organisation is registered,
            the project certification managers will receive a notification
            by email that there is a new organisation ready for review and approval.
            You can manage the list of certication managers for a project by
            clicking on the project edit button and then scrolling down until you find
            the certification managers list. Add and remove members from the
            list as needed and then save your project.

            The approval process is largely a norm established in your project.
            One approach that can be taken is to approve 'known' organisations
            associated with the project based on your knowledge of the
            organisation's skills and competencies. For organisations that
            are not known to the project, a more rigorous process can be followed
            whereby moderators review the applicant certifying organisation's
            web site, ask to review their training course curricula, the
            training materials used by the organisation, or possibly even sit in
            on a training course conducted by the applicant to verify that they
            "know their stuff". Once the organisation has passed approval, the
            organisation owner and mangers will be able to proceed with
            setting up courses, conveners and so on using the management
            interface provided on projecta.

            The top of your organisation page gives a quick dashboard overview
            of your organisation, credits, training centers and attendees.

            A training center is a venue where you regularly conduct courses.
            Each organisation may have one or more training centers. If you
            are doing onsite or 'roaming' training, I suggest to either
            make a training center per location where you offer training, or
            create a single location (e.g. at your offices) that you can
            use as a proxy for other venues.

            A course convener is either the trainer or the person responsible

            the course convener on it. Be sure to upload a digital signature
            for each course convener if you do not want to manually print
            and sign the certificates.

            Course types describe the different content offering you offer.
            You can include how many hours of instruction that are included
            in the course. If you do this, this information will be included
            on the certificate when it is generated. Probably you will
            define your course types around topics (e.g. working with
            databases) or around skill leve (beginner, intermediate etc.).

            Once you have issued certificates for each attendee you can issue certificates.
            The process of registering an attendee and issuing the certificate is separated
            so you need only issue certificate to those that pass your course.

            Each attendee will receive an email with a link to a downloadable copy of the
            certificate. The certificate includes a unique number which is allocated to each certificate
            and a unique link that they can provide (for example in their CV) to
            verify that they have indeed completed the course. This mechanism should
            help to prevent fake certificates.

            Course conveners should upload a digital signature to their
            profile. This is embedded into the certificate together with
            the digital signature of the project leader (who needs to set this
            in the project profile options page).
